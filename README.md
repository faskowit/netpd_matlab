# netpd_matlab
implementation of network portrait divergence in matlab

See the [2008 paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/81/68004) for the introduction of the concept, and the [2019 paper](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0156-x) for the divergence function. 

This matlab is adapted from the following associated repos, which contain extra information:
